title: Mini Baja Speedometer
---

<p>
I designed my first printed circuit board for Case's Mini Baja Club. Every
year, the
club designed and built an off-road race car to compete in the
SAE Mini Baja competition.
</p>

<p>
It was great fun. I really enjoyed machining parts and welding the car
together. I didn't have much involvement in the mechanical design of the car,
just the fabrication. One year I decided to design a speedometer/odometer system. 
A magnetic sensor that we installed in the gear box sent out pulses every time a gear
tooth passed by. These pulses were read by an Atmel AVR microcontroller
which then displayed the speed and distance traveled on an LCD screen.

<p>
It was a very fun project because it involved both hardware and embedded
software. I really enjoy working at the boundary between the two.

I had the board made by 
<a href="http://expresspcb.com">expresspcb</a> 
and used their software to design it.
