title: FPGA Breakout Game

---
<p>
Most of my FPGA designs have been for industrial purposes, such as processing
signals and controling hardware. I haven't really used an FPGA in a truly interactive way.
I got the idea to create a video game on an FPGA right before a long business trip to China.
I knew I would be spending long hours on an airplane and in a Chinese factory and needed 
something more productive that watching TV in my hotel room when I wasn't in the factory.

<a href='https://github.com/jrward/qdbreakout'>You can see the code on Github.</a> Look in the
rtl folder to see my Verilog code. I am directly driving the 5 VGA pins (RGB, Vsync, Hsync)
with digital outputs on the Cyclone IV FPGA. A reistive divider is used to lower the 3.3 V
outputs to the appropriate VGA voltage levels for the red, green, and blue channels. The
digital Vsync and Hsync control signals which are spec'ed at 5 V work just fine at 3.3 V.
Player position is controled by a mechanical encoder driving two digital inputs with internal
pullup resistors.
