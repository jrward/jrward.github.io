title: Solid-Body Electric Guitar
---

<p>I desperately wanted an electric guitar, but being a poor high school 
student, I had no money. I first got the idea to build one myself
when I stumbled across this
<a href="http://mimf.com/">awesome guitar forum.</a>
Mimf.com gave me the confidence to attempt to build one myself. I actually
took the long way because I built a workbench and a spokeshave first.
</p>

<p>I worked very deliberately and didn't actually finish until my
sophomore year of college. It was worth the wait, though. Fortunately,
I took some photos on my quest for a home-made guitar.
