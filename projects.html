<h2>Personal Projects</h2>
<h3>Tech</h3>
<ul>
	
	<li><a href="http://www.aeroscope.io">Aeroscope Wireless Oscilloscope (2015-2017)</a>
	<p>It started off as a personal project with my longtime friend and former 
	Agilent/Keysight colleague Alex Lee. We made a pen-sized wireless oscilloscope probe
	that connects to a tablet or phone and eventually turned it into a company.
	</li>	

	<li><a href="breakout.html">FPGA Breakout Game (2013)</a>
	<p>
	I created a breakout game on an Altera Cyclone IV FPGA using Verilog.
	</p>
	</li>
	
	<li><a href="soccerbot.html">Autonomous Soccer Robot (2006)</a>
	<p>
	I helped created an autonomous soccer playing robot as
	part of a graduate mobile robotics class. A computer downloaded
	images from an overhead webcam, processed them,
	and sent instructions to the robot over WiFi.
	</p>
	</li>
	<li><a href="uwb_ekg.html">Ultra Wide Band EKG Transmitter/Receiver (2006)</a>
	<p>
	I made an ultra wideband transmitter and receiver to transmit EKG
	data from a patient and output it to a heart monitor. This was 
	a very intensive project that involved building a radio from the
	ground up.
	</p>
	</li>
	<li><a href="lna.html">Low Noise VHF Amplifier (2006)</a>
	<p>
	I made a low noise amplifier for MRI applications to amplify
	signals at 64 MHz.
	</p>
	</li>
	<li><a href="baja.html">Mini-Baja Speedometer/Odometer (2004-2005)</a>
	<p>This was the first embedded project I did by myself. It also
	was the first circuit board that I designed. The board displayed 
	speed and distance information to the LCD display of an off-road
	race car. I enjoyed helping to build the car as well.
	</p>

<h3>Craft</h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href="roman_bench.html">Roman Style Workbench (2017)</a>
	<p>Small woodworking bench that is ideal for aparments or other
	small dwellings. The major distinguishing feature is that you sit
	on it to work.</p>
	</li>
	
	<li><a href="guitar.html">Solid-Body Electric Guitar (2001-2002)</a>
	<p>Dreaming of having an electric guitar, but not being able to
	afford one, I decided to build my own. If you just count materials
	cost, it was cheaper, but if you factor in labor... 
	</p>
	<p>
	It was all worth it in the end.
	</p>
	</li>
	
	
	<li>Spokeshave (~2001)	
	<p>A spokeshave is a woodworking tool that is like a cross between
	a plane and a drawknife. It was used to make wagon spokes in 
	days past. I used my forge to harden some O-1 steel for the blade
	and carved the handle body from maple. Instead of carving spokes,
	I used this to carve my guitar neck.
	</p>
	</li>
	
	<li><a href="forge.html">Various Forges (~2000)</a>
	<p>I made several forges for heat-treating, blacksmithing, and melting
	aluminium.	   
	</p>
	</li>

</ul>
