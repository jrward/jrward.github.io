            <li><a href="breakout.html">FPGA Breakout Game</a>
            <p>
            I created a breakout game on an Altera Cyclone IV FPGA using Verilog.

            <li><a href="soccerbot.html">Autonomous Soccer Robot</a>
            <p>
            I helped created an autonomous soccer playing robot as
            part of a Mobile Robotics class. A computer downloaded
            images from an overhead webcam, processed them,
            and sent instructions to the robot over WiFi.

            <li><a href="uwb_ekg.html">Ultra Wide Band EKG Transmitter/Receiver</a>
            <p>
            I made an ultra wideband transmitter and receiver to transmit EKG
            data from a patient and output it to a heart monitor. This was 
            a very intensive project that involved building a radio from the
            ground up.

            <li><a href="lna.html">Low Noise VHF Amplifier</a>
            <p>
            I made a low noise amplifier for MRI applications to amplify
            signals at 64 MHz.

            <li>Motor Driven Mountain Bike Conversion
            <p>
            Presented with an old rusty mountain bike and some power wheelchair
            motors, I decided to make an electric mountain bike. This was my
            first TIG welding project. I welded a bike sprocket onto a hub for
            attachment to the motor shaft. The welds turned out okay, but the 
            sprocket got pretty warped. You have to watch the temperature...
            </p>
            <p>
            I did most of the motor drive circuitry and the necessary machining.
            I shelved the project when I blew some catch diodes during testing.
            Another Case Project Club member finished everything after I graduated.

            <li>Golf Cart Instrumentation and Display System
            <p>
            This was my first senior project. I designed some hardware to
            provide diagnostics on an alumnnus' home-made golf cart. My friend
            Chris did the embedded software work for the board and Aaron and
            a different Chris worked on integrating a motor controller with
            regenerative braking. The diagnostic system was able to measure
            speed, distance traveled, game time, battery voltage, drive current,
            and instantaneous power.

            <li><a href="baja.html">Mini-Baja Speedometer/Odometer</a>
            <p>This was the first embedded project I did by myself. It also
            was the first circuit board that I designed. The board displayed 
            speed and distance information to the LCD display of an off-road
            race car. I enjoyed helping to build the car as well.

            <p>During my freshman year, this was my group's final project for 
            our advanced C++ class. It was a pretty big leap from console
            to GUI applications. I spent all of Thanksgiving break pounding 
            out windows code. Nick worked on the graphics engine, Anatoly
            did the physics, and Travis did some algorithm work for the AI.

            <li><a href="guitar.html">Solid-Body Electric Guitar</a>
            <p>Dreaming of having an electric guitar, but not being able to
            afford one, I decided to build my own. If you just count materials
            cost, it was cheaper, but if you factor in labor... 
            </p>
            <p>
            It was all worth it in the end.

            <li>Spokeshave	
            <p>A spokeshave is a woodworking tool that is like a cross between
            a plane and a drawknife. It was used to make wagon spokes in 
            days past. I used my forge to harden some O-1 steel for the blade
            and carved the handle body from maple. Instead of carving spokes,
            I used this to carve my guitar neck.

            <li><a href="forge.html">Various Forges</a>
            <p>I made several forges for heat-treating, blacksmithing, and melting
            aluminium.

            <p>I went to college at Case Western Reserve University and graduated with 
            a B.S. in electrical engineering in January of 2007.
