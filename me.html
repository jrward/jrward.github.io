<p>I went to <a href="college.html">college</a> at Case Western Reserve University (B.S. 2007)
and <a href="grad_school.html">grad school</a> at Columbia University (M.S. 2010), studying 
electrical engineering at both. I've had a few engineering <a href="work.shtml">jobs</a>
throughout the years.</p>

<p>I have many diverse interests, almost too many to keep track of. I like rock
climbing, surfing, sailing, hiking, biking, photography, woodworking, 
metalworking, electronics, programming,...
</p>

<p>I really like to create things. That is probably a reason why I became an
engineer. I get to create things for a living. 
</p>

<p>I enjoy hardware and software design. I really like
working at a low level. Gaining a deep understanding of whatever I am working
on is a great thrill for me. Given that, I tend to gravitate torwards analog
hardware and low level software. That said, it is also very fun to work at a 
high level and build a complete system. For that, software is generally more 
fun because the debugging tools are better.
</p>

<p>I first knew I wanted to be an engineer when I joined my high school's
FIRST robotics club (team 63) and got to work with some smart
engineers from GE volunteering their time. FIRST robotics was a great
experience. It was fun to see all the hard work pay off with a functional
machine that did what you told it to do.
</p>

<p>I think I would still be an engineer without FIRST. I had already
discovered programming and was intrigued that one could get paid for
writing programs, which was so much fun. FIRST served to cement my career
plans.
</p>

<p>I spend much of my free time rock climbing and thinking about rock 
climbing. I got hooked in Februrary, 2008. Ever since then, I have been
climbing nonstop. I used to mostly boulder in a gym and on the Sonoma coast. 
Then, I started a progression from toproping outside to sport climbing and 
finally to trad climbing in the summer of 2009. My first trad climbing 
experience was with my friend Brian at Seneca Rocks in West Virginia. We did 
a five pitch route called "Old Ladies Route" up to the summit. I later bought 
some gear and started climbing in the Gunks while in grad school.
</p>

<p>I used to go surfing and sailing a lot. I was a member of the Cal Sailing
Club and would drive down to Berkeley on the weekends to go sailing. I eventually 
stopped sailing and surfing much because it was hard to get the weather and tides 
to cooperate when I had free time. When I discovered rock climbing, the urge to 
drive and hour or more just to check the weather disappeard. I will eventually 
pick both back up again, but I think I will need to live very close to the ocean 
to do so.
